1. INTRODUCTION

The issue of Police Death is one of the numerous topics that is often overlooked or given less attention. Mr Christopher Wray who is the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a recent interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation stated that violence against the police is a phenomenon that doesn't get enough attention. The Police is an important part of the Law Enforcement Agencies in the Society as they play a huge role in bringing and maintaining order in the society. They are responsible for detection and prevention of crimes. Every Society needs the police because without them, the society will be hit with a lot of social vices.
As in the nature of their job, most times the police are exposed to numerous dangers which in some cases lead to their death. 

This project is therefore carried out to analyse the issues surrounding the Deaths of Police officers with focus on US Police Officers who died in the line of Duty. 

For this project, R Programming Language was used to perform a Descriptive Analysis of Police Deaths that have occured in America from January, 1791 - August, 2022. At the end of the Analysis, recommendations were made based on the insights gotten.

The dataset used for this analysis was provided by Mayuresh Koli and made available on Kaggle.

2. DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

After importing my data, I spent some time to understand the dataset. It contains 10 columns providing information like the Rank of the Victims, Name, Cause_of_Death, Date of Death etc. I  checked for data quality issues such as missing data,  duplication of information and then I ensured that the all values are formatted correctly. 

3. FINDINGS

After performing my exploratory analysis,  I found out that a total of over 26000 cases were recorded, and 50% of the recorded cases were caused by gunfire, followed by automobile crash, heart attack, motor cycle crash and vehicular attack. These five causes account for over 70% of deaths recorded in our data set.

I also noticed an unsual increase in the number of deaths recorded in year 2020 and 2021. It was shown that this increased was caused by the global pandemic COVID-19

The ranks that have recorded the most deaths are Patrolman, Police Officer and Deputy Sherrif.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS

- The issuance of license to firearms should be done with strict background check. Before a person is allowed to own a gun, there should be a thorough check of his past activities, his mental health state etc.
- There should be a strict law against unliscensed firearm dealers. These laws should be strictly implemented because unwanted gun dealers make it very easy for people with the wrong motives to get guns. Most times, all these dealers care about is money, they release guns to people as long as they are willing to pay.
- Automobile and Motorcycle crashes are also part of the top causes of police death in the US. A little search on the internet revaeled distraction as the major cause of this. 
- Opportunities and platforms for regular check ups should be provided and made compulsory for every member of the Police, this will help uncover any underlying health challenge that may lead to heart attack.
